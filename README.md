# Github Manager Explore

> This is a github project manager / browser, in it, I make use of the github v4 API "graphql" in which, to use it, a personal access token is required ["tutorial for creation"](https://www.google.com), in which it is stored in a cookie.  

## About Project

> This project is a functional model of "Vuejs 2x Typescript"/"Vuetify", making use of the "Composition API" with JSX/TSX, to get JSX to work I made use of ["babel-preset-vca-jsx"](https://github.com/luwanquan/babel-preset-vca-jsx), thank you very much for the developer for that!
